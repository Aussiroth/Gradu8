# Gradu8
Orbital Gradu8

This serves as a repository for the Unity project.

This game is about our protagonist trying to survive 4 years of education without being caught by the dreaded deadline symbolised by the black ‘D’ character. It is a 2D side scrolling platformer played in landscape mode. 
The player will be running towards the right, while being chased by a black clad ‘D’ character. There will be multiple platforms that that the player must jump to and fro on.
The player must not fall off the platforms or be caught by the ‘D’ character, or the game will be over. The player can choose to swap between 3 different speeds of their character during the game.
The faster your character move, the more difficult it is but you get more rewards.
We currently intend to have 4 different stages to play on.
